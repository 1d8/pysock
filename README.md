# Pysock 
## "Reverse Shell" in Python 3 (For Educational Purposes)

## Use the code.py for linux machines, use win_shell.py for Windows machines

## Used modules:

* Socket
* Subprocess

# Requirements

* Python 3
* Netcat

# Steps

1. Change host & port variables to your needs

2. Listen with netcat on the corresponding port

3. On test machine, execute the code & wait for the connection

4. Start sending commands

# NOTE: Theoretically, if the test machine doesn't have python installed to run the code, you can use Pyinstaller in order to compile the code into an executable but note the exe file will be rather large
